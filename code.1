Write a function named "read" that takes in an "address" variable.
Declare a variable named "value" and set it to 0.
Set the pin mode for the SDA line to OUTPUT and the clock line to INPUT.
Set the clock line to HIGH.
AND the "address" variable with 0x7F and store the result in "address."
Begin a loop that iterates 8 times.
Within the loop, set the clock line to LOW.
Set the pin mode for the SDA line to OUTPUT.
If the current bit of "address" is 1, set the SDA line to HIGH. If not, set it to LOW.
Delay for 10 microseconds.
Set the clock line to HIGH.
Delay for 10 microseconds.
Repeat steps 7-12 for all 8 bits of the "address" variable.
Delay for 120 microseconds.
Set the pin mode for the SDA line to INPUT and enable the internal pull-up.
Begin a loop that iterates 8 times.
Within the loop, set the clock line to LOW.
Delay for 10 microseconds.
Set the clock line to HIGH.
Delay for 10 microseconds.
If the value read from the SDA line is HIGH, OR "value" with the current bit of the loop.
Repeat steps 16-21 for all 8 bits of the "value" variable.
Return the "value" variable.
