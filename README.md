Give the TEC-1 the ability to crudely see using a ADNS2610 chip ripped out of an old optical mouse or spare a few dollars and get a new one. A mounted adjustable lens is a must as the lens in the mouse is for mm range thus useless.

The idea is the capture the serial steam and send it to buffer for analysis. The sensor looks at 8x8 pixels, thus 64 bit frames or 8 bytes. There are some sophisticated DSP features in this chip that can be later exploited for more complex uses.

For vision perhaps we want to recognise, edges, tone, changes between pixels and apply this to AI or motor control.
